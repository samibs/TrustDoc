## About Section (Longer Description)

You can add this in the repository's "About" section or README:

```
TDF (TrustDoc Financial) is an open document format designed for financial and corporate documents requiring cryptographic integrity verification.

Key Features:
• Cryptographic Integrity: Merkle tree-based integrity verification (SHA-256, BLAKE3)
• Digital Signatures: Ed25519 and secp256k1 signatures with key revocation
• Semantic Extraction: Structured data (tables, diagrams) as machine-readable JSON
• Tamper-Evidence: 100% attack detection rate in security testing
• Open Format: CC0 public domain specification, no vendor lock-in
• Fast Verification: ~1300 operations per second

Perfect for:
• Financial services (regulatory compliance, audit trails)
• Legal documents (tamper-evidence, non-repudiation)
• Healthcare (HIPAA compliance, patient records)
• Government (transparency, public records)

Built with Rust (core library) and TypeScript (SDK), with viewers for web, desktop, and mobile.

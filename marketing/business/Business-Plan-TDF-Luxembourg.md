# TrustDoc Format (TDF)
## Business Plan - Luxembourg Financial Services Market

**Version 1.0 | January 2026**
**Confidential**

---

## Executive Summary

**Opportunity**: Luxembourg's €5.9 trillion fund industry and 140+ banks lack a standardized, cryptographically-verified document format. Current reliance on PDF/Excel creates €180M+ annually in fraud losses, compliance failures, and operational inefficiencies.

**Solution**: TrustDoc Format (TDF) - an open document standard providing cryptographic integrity, multi-party signatures, and machine-readable structured data.

**Business Model**: Hybrid open-source/commercial with three revenue streams:
1. Enterprise licenses for integration support
2. Managed service (TDF-as-a-Service)
3. Compliance certification and audit services

**Financial Projections** (5-year):
- Year 1: €180,000 revenue (pilot phase)
- Year 3: €2.4M revenue (market expansion)
- Year 5: €8.5M revenue (EU scale)
- Break-even: Month 18

**Investment Required**: €450,000 seed funding
